# sudan_crowdsourcing

This is a project as part of my time at LSHTM aimed at aiding local people in Sudan in finding Healthcare Service providers during the current crisis.

The project is in collaboration with a team of staff and students at LHSTM. 

The aims of the project are to:
- Develop an online form for sharing available healthcare services in Sudan
- Create a publicly available database of active healthcare services in Sudan
- Develop a simple website which enables (1) adding to the healthcare service database and (2) navigation of the database of services via a simple search interface and an interactive map
